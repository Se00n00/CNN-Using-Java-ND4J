## **Overview**

This project is a hands-on implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Java using ND4J. CNNs are powerful neural networks widely used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. The repository demonstrates:

- Preprocessing data for training CNNs.
- Defining and training a CNN using ND4J.
- Evaluating model performance on a test dataset.

This project is a great resource for Java developers interested in machine learning and deep learning.

## **Features**

- **Custom CNN Implementation**: Build a CNN model step by step in Java.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Modify layers, activation functions, and optimizers.
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Load and normalize image data.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Train the CNN on a sample dataset and evaluate its accuracy.
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representation of training metrics like loss and accuracy.
