# **CNN Using Java with ND4J**

Welcome to the **CNN Using Java with ND4J** repository! This project demonstrates how to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Java using the ND4J (Numerical Computing for Java) library. ND4J provides high-performance tensor computation, making it a powerful choice for machine learning and deep learning tasks in Java.

## **Overview**

This project is a hands-on implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Java using ND4J. CNNs are powerful neural networks widely used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. The repository demonstrates:

- Preprocessing data for training CNNs.
- Defining and training a CNN using ND4J.
- Evaluating model performance on a test dataset.

This project is a great resource for Java developers interested in machine learning and deep learning.

## **Features**

- **Custom CNN Implementation**: Build a CNN model step by step in Java.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Modify layers, activation functions, and optimizers.
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Load and normalize image data.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Train the CNN on a sample dataset and evaluate its accuracy.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **ND4J**: Numerical computation library for deep learning in Java.
- **Maven**: Build automation tools.

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**  
   Ensure JDK 11 or higher is installed.  
   [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

2. **Maven**  
   Install Maven for dependency management.  
   [Maven Installation Guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

3. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Se00n00/CNN-Using-Java-ND4J.git
   cd CNN-Using-Java-ND4J
## **Usage**

### **Step 1: Get all the dependecies**
- Reload the pom.xml to resolve all the required dependencies
- In case of `artifact nor found error`, visit maven repository to get the info of correct version

### **Step 2: Clear Resources and Mention your Dataset Directory**
- If You wish to work on your own dataset, clear the resources first (any thing iniside it)
- Inside `Main.java` change the already mention path of your dataset to your dataset in local

### **Step 3: Train the Model**
- Run the `Main.java` file to start the training process:
  ```bash
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
- It will first check if the preprocessed data exists in resources or not if not, then would prepare the dataset
- Then the actual training of model would start

- **`src/main/MAIN`**: Contains the Java source files, including:
  - `Main.java`: Entry point to initialize and train the CNN.
  - `Main.java`: Core logic for defining and training the CNN architecture.

- **`resources/dataset`**: Placeholder for dataset files. Organize images in subdirectories by class.

- **`output/models`**: Directory where trained models are saved.

- **`output/logs`**: Contains training logs and metrics.

- **`pom.xml`**: Maven configuration file to manage dependencies.

## **CNN Architecture**

The Convolutional Neural Network implemented in this project consists of the following layers:

1. **Input Layer**: Accepts images of a fixed size (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
2. **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts spatial features from images using learnable filters.
3. **Activation Functions**: Applies non-linearity to introduce learning capabilities (e.g., ReLU).
4. **Pooling Layers**: Reduces spatial dimensions while retaining significant features.
5. **Fully Connected Layers**: Maps extracted features to output classes.
6. **Output Layer**: Produces probabilities for each class using softmax.

### **Example Architecture**

Modify the architecture in `Main.java` to suit your dataset and requirements.
