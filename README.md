## **Overview**

This project is a hands-on implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Java using ND4J. CNNs are powerful neural networks widely used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. The repository demonstrates:

- Preprocessing data for training CNNs.
- Defining and training a CNN using ND4J.
- Evaluating model performance on a test dataset.

This project is a great resource for Java developers interested in machine learning and deep learning.

- **Custom CNN Implementation**: Build a CNN model step by step in Java.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Modify layers, activation functions, and optimizers.
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Load and normalize image data.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Train the CNN on a sample dataset and evaluate its accuracy.
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representation of training metrics like loss and accuracy.

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**  
   Ensure JDK 11 or higher is installed.  
   [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

2. **Maven**  
   Install Maven for dependency management.  
   [Maven Installation Guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

3. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Se00n00/CNN-Using-Java-ND4J.git
   cd CNN-Using-Java-ND4J
## **Usage**

### **Step 1: Load and Preprocess the Data**
- The dataset should be organized in the `resources/dataset` directory.  
- Each class should have its own folder containing respective images.  
- The `DataLoader` class is responsible for:
  - Reading image files.
  - Resizing them to a uniform dimension.
  - Normalizing pixel values to improve training stability.

### **Step 2: Define the CNN Architecture**
- The CNN architecture is implemented in the `CNNModel.java` file.  
- Modify the following parameters to customize the architecture:
  - **Number of convolutional layers**: Add or remove layers as required.
  - **Kernel size and stride**: Define kernel dimensions for each layer.
  - **Activation functions**: Choose from functions like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh.
  - **Pooling layers**: Use max pooling or average pooling to reduce spatial dimensions.
  - **Fully connected layers**: Configure the number of neurons in dense layers.

### **Step 3: Train the Model**
- Run the `Main.java` file to start the training process:
  ```bash
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"

## **CNN Architecture**

The Convolutional Neural Network implemented in this project consists of the following layers:

1. **Input Layer**: Accepts images of a fixed size (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
2. **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts spatial features from images using learnable filters.
3. **Activation Functions**: Applies non-linearity to introduce learning capabilities (e.g., ReLU).
4. **Pooling Layers**: Reduces spatial dimensions while retaining significant features.
5. **Fully Connected Layers**: Maps extracted features to output classes.
6. **Output Layer**: Produces probabilities for each class using softmax.

### **Example Architecture**

Modify the architecture in `CNNModel.java` to suit your dataset and requirements.
